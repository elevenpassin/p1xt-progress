# Progress towards my learning goals

In each folder, separated by year, are my notes, etc related to what I'm studying, doing, learning...

If you're looking to see what I'm up to, you most likely want to grab the pdf file, as I'm recording everything in latex and it's being all consolidated into [progress.pdf](2018/progress/progress.pdf).

## 2018

My dual main goals are to A) study algorithms in depth and B) explore Physics. To that end, I am including a variety of Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics courses, with no prescribed order. I'll just select the next course in whatever list I'm most inspired to continue each time I'm ready to progress to a new course. (I've selected all three MITOCW lists from the course-paths, and I'll be hopping between them willy-nilly.)
